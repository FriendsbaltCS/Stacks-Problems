1. `valid_parens.py`: Given a string of parentheses, brackets, and braces, determine if it is a valid parenthetical expression. An expression is valid if and only if every opening bracket (or parenthesis or brace) has a corresponding closing brace and vice versa and brackets are closed in the correct order (i.e. all inner brackets are closed before outer ones) 

    For example "[ ( ) { } ]" is a valid expression while "( { ) }" is not.
    

2. `sub_parens.py`: Given a string of parentheses, determine the length of the longest substring of valid parentheses. For example for ") ( ( ( ) ( ) ( ( " the answer would be 4.

3. `dijkstra.py`: Given an arithmetic expression as a string, evaluate it using the correct order of operations. Assume the expression contains only numbers (positive or negative), parentheses, and the operators +, -, *, /, and ^
